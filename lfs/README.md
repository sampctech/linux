Linux from scratch

LinuxFromScratch.org walkthrough.

As I'm attempting to learn & build, will put files here that may work elsewhere.

Starting OS is Debian 11 with Cinnamon desktop

Have put .bash_aliases with starting shortcuts for shutdown, reboot, install & reloading bash shell instance with new without closing (seems to be working - not sure if will work in ArchLinux)

Have to put bash_aliases in ~ & rename to .bash_aliases for debian based (possibly all)
