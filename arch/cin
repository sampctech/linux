Cinnamon

Personally I'm a fan of Cinnamon so I'm gonna tackle that first.
As I proceed, I will add others as I try them.
Check the corisponding files with those steps as I go about trying & writing them out.

Below will be what I've chosen for Cinnamon.
This will get updated over time as I find what I'm going to setup & install as well as tweak.

For login manager, I'm going with lightdm
I may try others, but I'm new. This has the most documentation on how to setup & tweak from what I've found.

To install :
    sudo pacman -S lightdm
    sudo pacman -S lightdm-gtk-greeter lightdm-gtk-greeter-settings
    sudo systemctl enable lightdm.service

Now for Cinnamon
    sudo pacman -S cinnamon

This is vanilla. We are going to tweak & make are own.
I really like different fonts & have used some different Terminal emulators.
As I find options I really, I will be updating this doc starting with the following:
(See below)


From installing ArcoLinux, I have found that customizing can be very easy with scripts, but I want to do this the hard way at first so no scripts yet.
My plan is to create scripts from what I've learned & make all this a very easy, 1 click type solution, but with full control by the user
