Let get graphical
Check the corisponding files with those steps as I go about trying & writing them out.

At this point, Arch is installed, we have a perfect base to start with, lets get visual.
Here we are going to install the starters than will be needed in all the desktops we try.
For the full list of "Packs" that get installed, for now see the packs doc.
This will change over time as I try the different enviroments so that Arch has one, then graphics & so on.
Once these steps are complete, I'm going to copy the image & move forward.

Here we are going to install the following
        sudo pacman -S xorg-server xorg-apps xorg-xinit xterm git wget bash-completion termite neofetch

This will make life eaier going forward with the display drivers, & helpers to get going.

So its we are ready for whats coming, its a good idea to enable the multilib repo.
This is done by uncommenting the [multilib] section in /etc/pacman.conf
sudo nano /etc/pacman.conf

[multilib]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirr

Here is a good place to setup our AUR yelpers.
I'm starting with just yay for now.
To install yay we need to do the following:
Clone the yay git repository
Change the file permissions from the root the sudo user.
Build the package using the makepkg command

$ cd /opt
$ sudo git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay-git.git
$ sudo chown -R NAME:users ./yay-git
$ cd yay-git
$ makepkg -si

Lastly we need to update yay
$ yay -Syu

To include development packages during the upgrade:
$ yay -Syu --devel --timeupdate

See Packs doc for more yay info
