This is my walk through from command line to install Arch linux
I will be installing through VirtualBox 6.1.10_Ubuntur138449
ArchLinux-2020.12.01
This is going to be an EUFI installation
I have enabled VBoxSVGA with 3D Acceleration
4G RAM
100G virtual drive
Simple


List of references that help with be listed through out, starting with E.D. & ArcoLinuxD.com

Once booted, chk data con
ping -c1 google.com

I'm in the US so I'm skipping changes to keyboard & language & so on.

Even though the startup showed the EUFI option to start, still varifing to make sure no issues
  efivar -l

UPDATE THE SYSTEM CLOCK
This seems to be a must, install fails if I skip this step, or even 1 part of it. Not sure if this is a VB or Arch issue.

date
timedatectl set-ntp true
date

Partition the disks
I am starting with a 100G virtual disk. Since I have 32G of DDR4-3000 in my machine I was going to split hardware,
but decided to make it more compatable with the system I hope to install on later.
I use cfdisk because thats what I'm comfortable with. Use what you are comfortable with.
You can make sure there is a dsrive & if there are any partitions there upon it with
  lsblk
  
 using cfdisk I created the following
 gpt
 1G   TYPE  EFI System
 2G   TYPE  Linux swap
 97G  TYPE  Linux filesystem
 
write = yes (lower case)

Formatting the partitions
1st the EFI
    mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/sda1

2nd the swap partition and activating it
    mkswap /dev/sda2
    swapon /dev/sda2

3rd the root partition.
    mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda3

Mount the file systems
    mount /dev/sda3 /mnt

    mkdir /mnt/boot

    mkdir /mnt/boot/efi

    mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot/efi

With Arch12/01/20 there is not a country list for mirrow where you can select local servers so ignored Mirrors steps
If you would like to check more recent or older installation disk

    nano /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
    
Install the base and base-devel packages
I also found that here is a great place to install some much needed extras
I installed these 1 after another than starteds another to see if they could all be done via 1 line
Not all of these are needed at this step, but because I am going to need them in every install I work on after this point, Itried to kill as many steps off as possible
will remove some if there is an error

base
base-devel
linux
linux-firmware
nano
reflector

the end result is 
    pacstrap /mnt base base-devel linux linux-firmware nano reflector

During install of linux-firmware, got error of missing firmware. these need to be updated after install completes:
wd719x
aic94xx
xhci_pci


FSTAB
    genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab

Check that FileSystemTABle is correct
    nano /mnt/etc/fstab


CHange ROOT directory:
    arch-chroot /mnt


TIMEZONE
 Edit Region/City accordingly
    ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Region/City /etc/localtime

Now set hardware clock
    hwclock --systohc

to check current time
    date


LOCALE
First we need to set your localization, language
    nano /etc/locale.gen
    locale-gen
    nano /etc/locale.conf
    LANG=en_US.UTF-8

IF you changed the keyboard layout 
    nano /etc/vconsole.conf
and add this line to it and save it afterwards
    KEYMAP=be-latin1


Shorter alternative
    echo LANG=en_US.UTF-8 > /etc/locale.conf
    echo KEYMAP=be-latin1 > /etc/vconsole.conf


HOSTNAME
    nano /etc/hostname

Write the name you have choosen for your computer.

Shorter alternative
    echo Archlinux > /etc/hostname

    nano /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1   localhost
::1	        localhost
127.0.0.1   Archlinux.localdomain Archlinux

NETWORK CONFIGURATION
We need to install a network manager. I chose networkmanager.
    pacman -S networkmanager
    systemctl enable NetworkManager


Initramfs
Creating a new intramfs is not required according to the wiki as result I will not create one with the command mkinitcpio -p linux.
NOTHING TO DO HERE

Root Password
We add a password to our root account
    passwd



Boot loader
For the boot loader I am starting with grub.
I will try others, cause why not, but start with smething that works
(you can add os-prober to the installation line if you multi-boot):
    pacman -S grub efibootmgr
    grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot/efi


We still need to make the grub configuration file with this command in order to be able to boot.
    grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

Now if everything is correct, we need to exit & reboot
    exit
    umount -R /mnt
    reboot



Once reboot completes, log in as root.
Now you can either shut the system down to make a copy of image or proceed
I found that making a copy before tweaking is useful.
There are a few things though that are a good idea to have going for the copy that will things a bit easier going forward.


First we want to make sur ewe have internet connection
    ping -c1 google.com

If connection is established, we can continue, if not, back again we go to isolate
    systemctl enable NetworkManager
    systemctl start NetworkManager

We need to update, but if we are going to use AUR, we musat edit mirrorlist first
    nano /etc/pacman.conf

Find [multilib] & remove #
    [multilib]
    include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist

Now we update with
    pacman -Syu

Now to add things that we can use, Liek an AUR helper.
We need to create an average user. You can tweak the groups if needed.
Lets create out very own personal account.
To do so, we start with the following, again, this can be tweaked if needed
Replace NAME with what you want
    useradd -m -g users -G audio,video,network,wheel,storage,rfkill -s /bin/bash NAME
    passwd NAME

For user “NAME” to do administrative tasks requires editing the visudo file installed by the base-devel group package.
    EDITOR=nano visudo

Look for this line of code and delete the hashtag in front of it.
    %wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL

Then logout with
    exit

Now log in as NAME & chk con
    ping...

& test update
    pacman -Syu
    
    shutdown now

Next we get our enviroment



Thanks to the groups & individuals that have provided all the info to allow this to be created & updated both up till now & going forwarded
See Thanks.txt for full list.
