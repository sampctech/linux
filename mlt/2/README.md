Tools & scripts to help with arch linux setup, tweaking & customizing.

  make-scripts-exes.sh    chmod +x this file then run & it will chmod all .sh files you create. (will need to modify)
 	1-updater.sh            Script to update pacman with Q&A to simplify the updating process.
	githubs.sh 	            Git clone all the needed repos to start learning & customizing Arco linux
  bashrc                  Already contains some keyboard shortcuts.
                          Plan on figuring out how to add more & auto impliment this into directory.
